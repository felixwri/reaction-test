# Reaction Game in PixiJS

## Getting Started

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

## Overview

Build a reaction test game using PixiJS and TypeScript. The game should look and feel like part of a competitive socialising experience rather than a flash game. This should take 2â€“4 hours to complete, depending on how polished you make it. Please don't go overboard, I'm just looking to see your code quality and ability to work with PixiJS.

I have provided a starting point project folder, you do not have to use it nor do you need to stick to the approach I have laid out.

## Game Requirements

### Idle Screen
- Displays game title/logo
- Shows a "Tap to Start" message
- Transitions into the play screen on interaction

### Play Screen
- After a random delay, signal the player to tap/click as fast as possible
- Measure the reaction time in milliseconds
- Show visual feedback if the player clicks too early

### Results Screen
- Display the player's reaction time
- Bonus points for storing scores and/or displaying a rank
- Return to idle screen after timeout and/or tap

## Technical Requirements

- Use PixiJS v8.x.x
- Written in TypeScript
- Bonus points for using GSAP to animate

## Deliverables

- A link to your GitHub repo with the full project
- A short README explaining:
  - How to run/build the project
  - Anything you'd add with more time
